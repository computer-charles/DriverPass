# DriverPass Project Portfolio

## Project Summary  
The DriverPass project was focused on designing a system for a client who wanted to improve driver education and licensing preparation. The client was DriverPass, a company aiming to provide students with online resources and scheduling tools to help them study for their driving tests. The system we were asked to design needed to allow students to access lessons and practice exams online while also giving administrators and instructors tools to manage scheduling, monitor student progress, and update content.  

## What I Did Well  
I believe I did a strong job clearly identifying the business requirements and translating them into technical specifications. My documents captured the client’s goals in a way that could be understood by both technical and nontechnical audiences, which is critical in system analysis and design.  

## What I Would Revise  
If I could revise one part of my work, I would revisit the UML diagrams in the system design document. While they were functional, I believe I could improve them by adding more detail about relationships between system components and refining the formatting for clarity. This would make the design even easier for developers to follow.  

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs  
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the project requirements and identifying the most important features from the client’s perspective, such as secure access, ease of scheduling, and accurate testing content. I then incorporated these into the design through use cases and diagrams. Considering the user’s needs is essential because if the system does not work for the end user, even the most technically sound system will fail to meet its purpose.  

## My Approach to Designing Software  
My approach to designing software involves gathering requirements, breaking them down into functional and nonfunctional needs, and then translating those into models and diagrams that developers can build from. In the future, I plan to use iterative design techniques, prototyping, and more user feedback sessions to validate that my designs match expectations before moving into full development. This combination of analysis, documentation, and user validation ensures a stronger final product.
